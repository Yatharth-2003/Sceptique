### What is Sceptique?

Sceptique is a web app aimed at easing the process of detecting fake news, Summarizing large documents and finding out the online public image related to a brand or celebrity name.

-With the Out-Truth feature we hope to weed out fake news on internet.

-Let people be able to read large T&C documents which many a time contain alot of questionable terms but people agree to them without reading just beacause of their humongus sizes.

-In this Day and Age the online public image matters alot to company or proffesional , using Press-N-Pulse one can find out about it and that too in any specified time range.

  To find the public image of a brand or a celebrity either enter a name , a URl to article or Picture of a handwritten article  with a given time period and the website runs a 
  sentiment analysis for you and tells about how much percentage of the articles made online in that time frame reflect a positive image and how many negative. It also successfully 
  detects and ignores fake news.
  
  The result is provided in form of relevant statistics.
